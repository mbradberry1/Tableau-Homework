# Tableau-Homework

I included the maps of popular start and stop points around NYC as requested. I think the data here is mostly unsurprising, with the most popular starts and stops coinciding with the most popular tourist destinations in the city (Union Station, Central Park, Broadway, etc.)

Additionally, I included 2 dashboards of information that I found surprising. First, there was a spike in rides per age group in the year 1969. I assume that riders are just selecting the first year the see when they sign up for Citibike instead of selecting their actual birth year, and that would account for the huge spike in rides for that year. Additionally, there was some weird data included for average duration of ride per birth year, with some entries in the 1800's and early 1900's. I would assume users are just picking a random year here as well, instead of selecting their actual birth year.

Second, the popular starts and ends for subscribers and casual riders were mostly the same, which surprised me. I would assume that the subscribers are not tourists but people who live in the city, and thus would not be attracted to popular tourist destinations.
